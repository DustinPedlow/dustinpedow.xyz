      <description>This is a simple tutorial on creating a youbsite in the cloud using OpenBSD and HTTPD. This is based on the same steps used to create the website you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on. The main focus is on security, minimalism and reliability. The reason OpenBSD was chosen is because It has amazing security settings out of the box and it&amp;rsquo;s very lightweight. This tutorial assumes you are a beginner but have some basic knowledge of DNS and unix commands.</description>
