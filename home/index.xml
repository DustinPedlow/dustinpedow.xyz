      <description>This is a quick look at sshlockout and how to effectively use it to ban attackers.
The sshlockout program is a extra layer of security that bans IP addresses that have reached a maximum threshold of failed password attempts. The sshlockout program originates from DragonFlyBSD and has been ported to OpenBSD. If you&amp;rsquo;re from the Linux world this is similar to Fail2Ban and is a very simple program. When sshlockout is setup using the settings shown in the manpage it will ban any IP address that exceeds 5 incorrect passwords in one hour.</description>

      <title>How to Setup a OpenBSD Website</title>

      <description>This is a simple tutorial on creating a website in the cloud using OpenBSD, HTTPD and HUGO. This is based on the same steps I used to create the website you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on. My main focus was on security, minimalism and reliability. I choose OpenBSD because It has amazing security settings out of the box and it&amp;rsquo;s very lightweight. This tutorial assumes you are a beginner but have some basic knowledge of DNS and unix commands.</description>
