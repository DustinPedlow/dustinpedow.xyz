<p>This is a very in depth breakdown of my workstation. I had originally had this article as bunch of mini articles and lists but it took up too much space on my website and I didn&rsquo;t like having tons of articles related to my workstation.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="desktop">Desktop</h2>
<hr>
<p>Gnome shell: Colliod-Dark-Dracula</p>
<p>Icons: EPapirus-Dark</p>
<p>Appications User Themes: Colloid-Dracula-Dark</p>
<p>Gnome Extensions: Bitcoin Markets, Dash to Dock, Mullvad Indicator and User Themes</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2>
<hr>
<p>I have made many shortcuts to make my Gnome desktop to switch workspaces and open commonly used applications. This is mainly used to up my productivity but also allows me to get used to shortcuts in case I want to use a tiling window manager.</p>
<p>Librewolf = Super+F</p>
<p>Tilix = Super+Enter</p>
<p>Nautilus = Super+3</p>
<p>Thunderbird = Super+E</p>
<p>Transmission = Super+Z</p>
<p>KeePassXC = Super+X</p>
<p>Strawberry = Super+S</p>
<p>Virt-Manager = Super+V</p>
<p>Webcord = Super+D</p>
<p>Microsoft Teams = Super+T</p>
<h4 id="navigation">Navigation</h4>
<p>Move to workspace above = Super+K</p>
<p>Move to workspace below = Super+J</p>
<p>Toggle Maximization State = Super+M</p>
<p>Close window = Super+Q</p>
<h3 id="startup-apps">Startup Apps</h3>
<p>Startup Apps on Debian: Coolero and GreenWithEnvy</p>
<h1 id="dock">Dock</h1>
<p>Only shows up on workspaces that do not have maximized windows</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<hr>
<p>My current terminal is Tilix because of it&rsquo;s Gnome desktop like design and it has the power to open more terminals within the same window. My current shell is zsh because it has really good autocomplete and the config file .zshrc is really easy to customize. For hardware info I use htop to check my CPU load and temps along with my ram usage, network usage, ZFS ARC usage and much more. My current text editor is NeoVim because I love the shortcuts of vim and find that the copy/paste of Neovim is better for Desktop use. I am currently hosting my email with ProtonMail and am using Thunderbird as my client. My networking/dns/firewall setup is using systemd Networkd, resolved and nftables because they are all well documented and very performant. I am also using rsyslog as my logging utility for my system logs.</p>
<p>I currently am using Transmission as my torrenting client to download all my Linux ISOs. I use KeePassXC for password management because it is very secure since it&rsquo;s opensource and is stored in a local database only with strong encryption. I have WebCord installed as my discord client because is is more privacy abiding than the Discord&rsquo;s application. I have Teams-for-Linux installed so I can access all my school classes and messages without needing to login and go through 2FA every time.</p>
<p>I dual boot into Windows 10 Pro purely for gaming to mainly play MineCraft Bedrock Edition. I have not bought a Windows license since I personally don&rsquo;t believe paying for a program that steals my data. So instead I prefer to debloat Windows and keep as little as needed to have gaming working. I am using Chocolatey and winget for package management since I don&rsquo;t want to manually update my software.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<hr>
<p>My workstation is filled with a mix of consumer and enterprise hardware. I personally like to have as much expansion as possible so lots of sata connectors and dual NICs are a must. This PC has been three years of upgrades and has gone from a modest gaming PC to a powerhouse of a workstation. The highlights are the 10 cores 20 threads of the i9 10900KF. I have 64GB of ram to run tons of Virtual Machines. The 2 NICs one 10G for the local network and a 2.5 which is used for experimenting with VMs. Two 1TB NVME drives in a Raid0 which gives super fast I/O perfromance to run tons of Virtual Machines. I have a IBM SAS card and a SAS expander card to allow for a extra 20 SATA3 ports. My case is the Fractal Define 7 XL which can support loads of storage devices! The graphics card I have is a AMD RX 6800 which is a good mid-high end GPU that has a whole 16GB of VRAM and runs all my games at high framerates easily!</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="storage-configuration">Storage Configuration</h2>
<hr>
<p>My storage configuration is complicated since I like to keep backups and have redundancy where possible.</p>
<p>The Samsung 870 1TB SSD is my boot drive and has been partitioned with EXT4 for Debian 12. The Samsung 870 1TB is a single zpool called tank. This zpool has snapshots enabled and has a subdirectory called tank/home that is mounted at /home/dusti as my home folder. The two WD SN550 1TB NVME drives are in a BTRFS Raid0 and runs all of my Virtual Machines. This gives my great I/O performance for all of my VMs which is especially noticeable on my Lan7.net lab network which is using lots of Windows 10 machines and is running many resource heavy services that are very responsive on my machine. These NVME drives are mounted at /home/dusti/VMs. My two WD_Black 1TB HDDs are in a ZFS mirror named Backup located at /Backup. This pool has basic backup setup using borgbackup and automated with scripts for crontab. Snapshots are turned off on the Backup zpool has snapshots turned on in case of a ransomware attack I still can rollback my BorgBackup database and then recover my data.</p>
<p>I have many different tasks running in order to keep my data safe. I have default zfs-auto-snapshot setup with mostly default snapshot settings since they are quite sensible. All of these zpools are scrubbed each day at 3:00pm along with the BTRFS NVME pool. I do a trim of all BTRS and ZFS pools every Sunday at 1:00pm. My Virtual Machines on my workstation are used for testing and backups are not essential. I do however keep a backup just in case I lose a VM and don&rsquo;t want to reconfigure it. I also keep default images of my all Lan7.net VMs which is my experimental network for when I decide to wipe them and start fresh.</p>
<p>I also dual boot to Windows 10 Pro because it supports games better. My Samsung 860 EVO is partitioned with NTFS with multiple partitions. I have a 100GB partition for Windows 10 files mounted at C:\ and The rest is mounted on G:\ for Games.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="backup-solution">Backup Solution</h2>
<hr>
<p>I am currently using Borgbackup to backup all of my data to the /Backup zpool. I have extensively tested my backup solution many times in test disaster recovery scenarios. It has also save my butt quite a few times. I have borked my system, had hard drives fail and have accidentally delete files. In all these situations with the methods I use it was easily able to recover my data within minutes. I am currently using borgbackup to store multiple backup databases on my Backup zpool mounted at /Backup. I have backups for my home, ISOs and VMs split up for easier recovery. These are located at /Backup/BorgBackup/home, /Backup/BorgBackup/ISOs and /Backup/BorgBackup/VMs.</p>
<p>I have ZFS snapshots setup on my zpools in case of malware and it is also very quick at rolling back or recovering a single file. I have left the zfs-auto-snapshot configuration set ti increments of 15 minutes up to a hour, every hour up to 24 hours, any day in the month and any month up to 3 years ago.</p>
<p>I also keep a off-site offline backup of my files using BluRay just in case. I don&rsquo;t really have much offsite since in the case of my house burning down or some other disaster the data on my computer is not very valuable to me. I don&rsquo;t really have much but some family photos that are offsite as I am fine to lose all my ISOs and VMs on my since they are not mission critical.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="power-consumption">Power Consumption</h2>
<hr>
<p>I used powertop which is a handy power consumption tool that can tune my power consumption and can see my Cstate modes and many other settings. I found that my lowest power state my workstation can reach is C3 which knowing that I have a fairly new machine didn&rsquo;t seem quite right. I’m not really sure what is causing a C3 Cstate exactly but I’m pretty sure it is my SAS controller. The reason I think that is because older firmware does not support above C3 Cstates and my SAS card not very current.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="idle-hardware-usage">Idle hardware usage:</h2>
<hr>
<p>idle cpu: 800Mhz and 0.5% usage on all cores</p>
<p>idle ram: 1.98GB (opened tilix and htop after booting)</p>
<br/>
<h1 id="clocking-and-cooling-tweaks">Clocking and Cooling tweaks</h1>
<hr>
<p>Before beginning this section I would like to direct you to my <a href="/home/pc-tuning">PC Tuning page</a> for reference on my opinion of overclocking/undervolting and the like. My workstation is completely stable running my workload of multiple VMs, gaming and has passed tons of 24 hour benchmarks and stress tests. It is running at default speeds but using less power which is pretty awesome since less heat means my components will last longer and my room will stay cooler!</p>
