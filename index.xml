      <description>This is a quick look at sshlockout and how to effectively use it to ban attackers on OpenBSD machines.
The sshlockout program is a extra layer of security that bans IP addresses that have reached a maximum threshold of failed password attempts. The sshlockout program originates from DragonFlyBSD and has been ported to OpenBSD. If you&amp;rsquo;re from the Linux world this is similar to Fail2Ban and is a very simple program.</description>

      <description>Hello internet! My name is Dustin and I am currently a Network Administration Technology student at my local college. In my spare time I enjoy working on my homelab and learning about both Windows and Unix-like operating systems. I have a love of Linux and the opensource project that power it. I also like learning about cyber security and how to make systems more secure and reliable. I am a bit of a hardware enthusiast and love to build/upgrade computers and spend hours tweaking the performance and power useage to fit the use of the computer or server.</description>
