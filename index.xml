      <description>This is a appreciation article to sshlockout. Yep I&amp;rsquo;m a shill.
The sshlockout program is a extra layer of security that bans IP addresses that have reached a maximum threshold of failed password attempts. The sshlockout program originates from DragonFlyBSD and has been ported to OpenBSD. If you&amp;rsquo;re from the Linux world this is similar to Fail2Ban and is a very simple program. When sshlockout is setup using the settings shown in the manpage it will ban any IP address that exceeds 5 incorrect passwords in one hour.</description>

      <title>How to Setup a OpenBSD Website</title>

      <description>This is a simple tutorial on creating a website in the cloud using OpenBSD, HTTPD and HUGO. This is based on the same steps I used to create the website you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on. My main focus was on security, minimalism and reliability. I choose OpenBSD because It has amazing security settings out of the box and it&amp;rsquo;s very lightweight. This tutorial assumes you are a beginner but have some basic knowledge of DNS and unix commands.</description>

      <description>Hello internet! My name is Dustin and I am currently a Network Administration Technology student at my local college. In my spare time I enjoy working on my homelab and learning about both Windows and Unix-like operating systems. I have a love of Linux and the opensource project that power it. I also like learning about cyber security and how to make systems more secure and reliable. I am a bit of a hardware enthusiast and love to build/upgrade computers and spend hours tweaking the performance and power useage to fit the use of the computer or server.</description>
