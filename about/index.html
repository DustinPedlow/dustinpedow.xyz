<meta name="twitter:description" content="Hello internet! My name is Dustin and I am a recent graduate Network Administration Technology student at my local college. In my spare time I enjoy working on my homelab and learning about both Windows and Unix-like operating systems. I have a love of Linux and the opensource project that power it. I also like learning about cyber security and how to make systems more secure and reliable. I am a bit of a hardware enthusiast and love to build/upgrade computers and spend hours tweaking the performance and power useage to fit the use of the computer or server."/>
